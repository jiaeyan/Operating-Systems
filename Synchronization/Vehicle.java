/**
 * A Vehicle is a Runnable which enters tunnels. You must subclass
 * Vehicle to customize its behavior (e.g., Car and Sled).
 *
 * When you start a thread which runs a Vehicle, the Vehicle will
 * immediately begin trying to enter the tunnel or tunnels passed into
 * its constructor by calling tryToEnter on each Tunnel instance. As
 * long as tryToEnter returns false (indicating that the Vehicle did
 * not enter that tunnel), the Vehicle will keep trying. This is
 * called busy-waiting.
 *
 * In addition to recreating the constructors, the only method that
 * you must override in Vehicle subclasses is getDefaultSpeed. This
 * instance method is called from the private init method, and the
 * integer that it returns is used as the speed for the vehicle.
